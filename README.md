## Why we use cucumber in Automation?

Cucumber is a testing tool that enables behavior-driven development (BDD) in software development projects. It facilitates communication between technical and non-technical team members by using a simple, human-readable syntax called Gherkin. Cucumber helps teams to create and execute automated acceptance tests for their software, allowing them to quickly identify and fix issues, and ensure that the software meets business requirements. Additionally, it helps to improve collaboration between developers, testers, and business analysts, resulting in a better understanding of the project's objectives and requirements. Overall, Cucumber is a valuable tool for software development teams looking to improve their testing process and ensure high-quality software.
